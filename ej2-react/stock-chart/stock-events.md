# Stock events in React Stock chart component

Stock Events visualizes stock events in stock chart. 'SplineSeries' is used to represent selected data value. You can customize the specific data value using `stockEvents` event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/stock-chart/working-with-data-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/stock-chart/working-with-data-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/stock-chart/working-with-data-cs1" %}

**Stock Events for individual series**

By default, stock events will be showed for all series. Now, you can set the stock events for particular series using `seriesIndexes` property.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/stock-chart/working-with-data-cs2/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/stock-chart/working-with-data-cs2/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/stock-chart/working-with-data-cs2" %}
