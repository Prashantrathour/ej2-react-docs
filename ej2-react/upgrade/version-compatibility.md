## Syncfusion version information

In a year, Syncfusion releases new volumes once every three months. Syncfusion React components follows sequence-based identifiers to process software releases based on the **YearlyVersion.Major.Revision** format to track all the release changes. It helps developers to keep track of the changes in every release.

For example, if the release package version is `20.2.36`, the version number indicates the details as follows,

* **20** denotes the `yearly release` version, which changes every year.
* **2** denotes the `major release` version. Once every three months, Syncfusion releases a new volume. Here, 2 represents the second release of the year.
* **36** denotes the `revision number` also known as the `patch number`, which increases for each service pack release and weekly patch release.
